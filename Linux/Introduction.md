### Introduction to Linux
Linux is a powerful, open-source Unix-like operating system kernel first developed by Linus 
Torvalds in 1991.
# Characteristics
 * Multitasking
 * Multi-user support
 * Portability across architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc.)
 * Security via permission models, namespaces, cgroups
 * Stability and Uptime (often runs for years without reboot

Everything is a File: Devices, sockets, pipes, configs — all treated as files

# Distribution
A distribution = Linux Kernel + Package Manager + Default Utilities + Desktop/CLI + System 
Configs
General use - Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora
Enterprise - RHEL, SUSE, Oracle Linux
Cloud/server - Ubuntu server, Amazon Linux, Centos stream

#  Real-World Applications of Linux

 * Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP all use Linux underneath
 * Web Servers: Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Node.js — all commonly run on Linux
 * DevOps Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab — all built for Linux first
 * AI/ML/Dev Environments: TensorFlow, PyTorch — commonly deployed 
   on Ubuntu/Debian
 * Gaming: Steam Deck uses Arch Linux; Proton enables Windows game compatibility
