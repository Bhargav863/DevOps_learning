## What is helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes (similar to apt for Ubuntu or yum for CentOS). It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and upgrading applications on Kubernetes.

Without Helm: You need to manually write multiple YAML manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, etc.), apply them using kubectl, and maintain them.

With Helm: You package all these manifests into a Helm Chart, making installation and upgrades as easy as:
```
helm install my-app ./my-chart
```

Let's take the catalogue manifest as an example from k8-roboshop project.

Here what will change frequently, if you deploy it across different environments.
  1) image --> Image version will keep on changing.
  2) Namespace --> namespace will change based on env (prod,staging)
  3) ReplicaCount --> replica count may change.
How helm helps in this scenario
  1) We will keep the main files aside and edit the required files.
  2) Parameterizes values â†’ No manual YAML edits. Without touching mainfiles, we will send parameters.
  3) Supports multi-environment configs via values.yaml.
  4) Provides easy upgrade & rollback:
     ```
     helm upgrade catalogue ./mychart --set image.tag=1.0.1
     ```
**Purpose of helm is for 2 things**
1) Parameterize the kubernetes manifest files.
2) It acts as kubernetes package manager.

**Charts**

Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. 
A chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. 

```
  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
  LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
  README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
  crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
  templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
```
